## Problem statement
### Mission
Enhance the way cyclists manage their bike rides.
### Vision
Become the most widely used app among cyclists.
### Purpose
Evolve into an app loaded with premium features, something most cyclists don't usually get from other apps for free.
### Problem
Many cyclists are on the hunt for an app that does more than just track distance. They want a calendar for events, heart rate monitoring, regular route planning, and in-depth performance analysis, basically, an all-in-one solution. Digging into the why's and how's, it struck me that most apps . Bt there are dangling premium services that this group of cyclists can't quite swing.
### Goal
Serve up an alternative for cyclists, with features that other apps usually put behind a paywall.
### Solution
This app throws open the doors to a range of premium features through monthly challenges. Hit those goals, earn those badges, and enjoy the perks—no mandatory monthly subscriptions required.
## Problem definition
I defined the problem by constructing a problem tree, breaking down causes and effects into direct and indirect factors on distinct branches.

Moving forward, I mapped out the user journey on the following page, highlighting pain points and high points to to steer the app should  focus.

From there, I crafted two personas and, with the assist of an empathy map, fleshed out their unique characters.

## Market Estimation
To assess the market, I sought data from cycling groups after finding no statistics in Peru's 2017 census. One group in Lima, per their social media, had conducted an independent census.

With no response from them, II pursued the Total Addressable Market (TAM) and Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM) using external data (see references). For specific age groups, I referred to a video on the cyclist census in Lima due to the unavailability of the document or contact with that cyclist group.

Finally, I checked the National Institute of Statistics and Informatics for the population figures in Peru and defined it as a micro-niche.

- ***TAM*** Estimated population in South America for 2022* **437,694,435**
- ***SAM*** Estimated population in Peru for 2022** **32,275,736**
- ***SOM*** Estimated population of people aged 20 to 54 living in Peru*** **14,438,436**

#### SOURCES
* *Taken from [Population Pyramid.net](https://www.populationpyramid.net/south-america/2022/)
* **Taken from [Cia.gov](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/peru/)
* ***Taken [fromInei.gob.pe](http://censos2017.inei.gob.pe)

### Targeting
- **Market:** Individuals in Peru aged 20 to 54.
- **Segment:** Peruvians aged 20 to 54 who commute by bicycle.
- **Niche:** Those aged 20 to 54 in Peru who actively plan their bicycle outings.
- **Micro niche:** Adults aged 20 to 54 who intend to utilize the app for organizing their bicycle journeys.

I began with the SOM, defining it as my market, and progressively narrowing down to the micro niche. While the app could be used by those outside the specified age range, my focus for the micro niche is on adults, Notably those comfortable using apps and likely to be economically active.

## Perceptual map
In today's cycling apps, users are offered limited functional choices, and many even include activities beyond cycling. Our app, on the other hand, empowers cyclists to access premium services without the usual monthly fees found in other apps. enhancing their overall cycling experience.
### DIRECT COMPETITION (Cycling only)
- Specialized.
- Trek.
- Ride with GPS.
- Zeopoxa.
### INDIRECT COMPETITION (Cycling and other activities)
- Strava.
- Relive.
- Garmin.
- Google Fit.
- Map My Ride.
- Wahoo.
- Training Peaks.
- Zwift*
*Indoor cycling.

## SWOT
In crafting the SWOT analysis, I took into account that both direct and indirect competitor apps handle metrics in a similar fashion, whether it's for cycling or other activities like running or trekking. Most of these apps have been around for a significant period.
#### STRENGTHS
- Enhanced trip management.
- App available in Spanish.
- Achievement of goals that can be redeemed for premium features.
#### WEAKNESSES
- Limited availability of exclusive apps for cyclists.
- Surge in cyclists after the pandemic.
- Sustaining premium features through goal achievements.
#### OPPORTUNITIES
- Providing more options without charging for premium services.
- Rapidly gaining popularity.
- Expanding across all of South America.
#### THREATS
- Other apps with longer market presence.
- Difficulty in differentiation from other apps.
- Possibility of other apps adopting a similar achievement system.

## Business Model
### FREEMIUM (Hybrid app)

For the initial month, all product features, spanning from basic to premium functions that are typically paid for in other cycling apps, will be fully accessible with no restrictions.

Following this trial period, cyclists can continue using all basic functions. To unlock the more advanced features, they have the option to subscribe monthly.

An alternative approach for cyclists to enjoy premium features is by engaging in challenges through bike-related activities. Upon successfully completing a challenge, they'll earn a medal, which can be accumulated. Cyclists can then exchange these medals to access the mentioned advanced features.

The app will serve as a recording tool for activities undertaken with the bicycle.

## Value Proposition Canvas

During the development of the brief, I conducted surveys, and the results revealed some pain points that were added to both the VPC and the MBC.

However, these functionalities remain as technical debt to be addressed in future iterations of the product.

Once the business model and, above all, the value proposition are identified, I will move on to the user experience.
