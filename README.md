## Problem statement
### Mission
Enhance the way cyclists manage their bike rides.
### Vision
Become the most widely used app among cyclists.
### Purpose
Evolve into an app loaded with premium features, something most cyclists don't usually get from other apps for free.
### Problem
Many cyclists are on the hunt for an app that does more than just track distance. They want a calendar for events, heart rate monitoring, regular route planning, and in-depth performance analysis, basically, an all-in-one solution. Digging into the why's and how's, it struck me that most apps . Bt there are dangling premium services that this group of cyclists can't quite swing.
### Goal
Serve up an alternative for cyclists, with features that other apps usually put behind a paywall.
### Solution
This app throws open the doors to a range of premium features through monthly challenges. Hit those goals, earn those badges, and enjoy the perksâ€”no mandatory monthly subscriptions required.
## Problem definition
I defined the problem by constructing a problem tree, breaking down causes and effects into direct and indirect factors on distinct branches.

Moving forward, I mapped out the user journey on the following page, highlighting pain points and high points to to steer the app should  focus.

From there, I crafted two personas and, with the assist of an empathy map, fleshed out their unique characters.
